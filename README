feud
====

Version 0.0.2 (November, 2018)

feud is a turn-based military and political strategy game. It is based on
medieval-styled board games I used to make and play (mostly with myself) as a
teenager.

Game rules

See file named RULES

Usage
-----

Currently, only game editor and hot-seat client are implemented. There is no
NPC, no network multiplayer, and no maps. "No NPC" means that you can not play
against computer, only against other humans (or against yourself). "No network
support" means that all players will use the same computer. "No maps" means
that you will have to use editor to create your own world (create grid, design
terrain, define regions, give them nice names, create players and set their
pieces).

To create a world, type 'feud-editor', create a map and populate it to your
liking.

To start the game, type 'feud' and play together with your friend(s).
