feud
====

Version 0.0.5 (May 2019)

feud is a turn-based military and political strategy game. It is based on
medieval-styled board games I used to make and play (mostly with myself) as a
teenager.

Usage
-----

Currently, only game editor, single player (vs computer) and local multiplayer
(hot-seat) are implemented. Computer player (AI) is very weak and mostly random.
There is no network, only local multiplayer, so all players will use the same
computer. There are no prebuilt maps, so you will have to use editor to create
your own world (create grid, design terrain, define regions, give them nice
names, create players and set their pieces). Alternatively you can use a wizard
to create a very simplistic world.

To create or edit a world, type 'feud-editor'. You can create a map and populate
it to your liking, or open an existing map and tweak it.

To play a hotseat game, type 'feud' and play together with your friend(s).

To play against [very stupid] AI, type 'feud-ai', pick a character and have fun.
